# Maximum Flow Problem with Genetic Algorithm
Maximum Flow Algorithm using DNAs and stuff
## What is this project?
This is a group final AI project on the Max Flow Problem using Genetic Algorithm. Our group use a simple implementation of the algorithm by taking advantage of the fact that a network can be represented by its weight matrix.

------------------------

## What is Maximum Flow Problem?
Maximum Flow Problem is a problem involving finding flows through a network, which is a directed graph with a source and sink vertex. For more information as well as formal definitions, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem#Definition).

## How do I run this program?
For Windows and Linux: It's easy! Just download the directory named 'Program' and run the main.exe file inside the directory.<br>
For MacOS: please view the instructions below.
### Help! I can't run main.exe?!!
If you cannot run main.exe. You can instead run the source code provided in the Code directory. Please follow these steps:<br>
1. First you need to install Python if you do not have Python installed on your computer.
2. Then, you need to download these three files in .\Code:
    * Individual.py
    * algorithms.py
    * main.py

3. You also need to download these Python libraries:
    * tkinter
    * matplotlib
    * networkx
    * tkmacosx (MacOS users MUST to install this library)

4. Finally, you can now run the program by running main.py. You can run this in any IDE/code editor that supports Python.

Please note that some features might not work properly on MacOS!
